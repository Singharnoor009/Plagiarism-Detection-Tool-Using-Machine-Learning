Predicting house prices is an important task in real 
estate market that affects the decisions of many 
stakeholders, from home buyers to sellers and investors. 
Traditional price predictions are often based on historical 
trends, comparisons and expert opinions. However, these 
methods may not capture the dynamic and non-linear 
relationships that exist in the real estate market. Machine 
learning can predict key values using various data points. 
This may include features such as location, square footage, 
number of bedrooms and bathrooms, lot size, and other 
features that may affect the price. This system will assimilate 
all these features using machine learning algorithms such as 
Random Forest [1] [2] and Gradient Boosting [3], providing 
better house price predictions than traditional methods.
